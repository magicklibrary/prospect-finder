User Guide & Setup Instructions

What Is This Tool?
Prospect Finder is a free, browser-based sales tool that helps freight brokerage reps find real, mid-sized manufacturing and distribution companies to call — organized by state or ZIP code and ready to export to Excel.

The core idea
You pick a state or ZIP code, the tool builds a research prompt, you paste it into ChatGPT (free), and it finds 5–8 real companies with phone numbers, bios, and decision-maker contacts. Bring the results back into the dashboard and download to Excel. No cost. No account needed. Works in any browser.

How to Use It
The tool runs in 3 steps. The whole process takes about 2–3 minutes per search.

1	Choose Your Territory
Open the tool and select either a State (to prospect an entire territory) or a ZIP Code (to find companies near a stop you're already making). Optionally narrow by industry — food & bev, chemicals, building materials, metal fab, and more.
2	Generate & Paste the Prompt into ChatGPT
Click "Build Prompt." The tool writes a ready-to-use research prompt and copies it to your clipboard automatically. Click "Open ChatGPT" — a new tab opens at chatgpt.com (free). Paste the prompt (Ctrl+V / Cmd+V) and press Enter. Wait 15–30 seconds for ChatGPT to respond.
3	Paste Results Back & Export
Copy ChatGPT's entire response. Come back to the Prospect Finder tab. Paste into the results box and click "Load Results." Company cards appear instantly. Click any card to expand full details. Hit "Download Excel" to save the list to your computer.

💡  Tip — ZIP Code Search
When you're visiting a customer in an area you don't know well, enter their ZIP code. The tool will find manufacturers and distributors within ~25 miles — so you can make the most of the trip and set up meetings nearby.

Tips for Best Results

•	If ChatGPT returns competitors (trucking, 3PL), click Refresh and try again — results vary slightly each time.
•	Use the industry filter to stay in your lane. If you sell to food companies, filter to Food & Beverage Manufacturing.
•	ZIP code searches work best for tight metro areas. For rural territories, use the state search instead.
•	You can run multiple searches in a row. Each time you load new results, the previous cards are replaced — export before you refresh if you want to save them.
•	ChatGPT sometimes formats its response slightly differently. If Load Results fails, scroll to find the JSON code block in ChatGPT's response, copy just that section, and paste again.

Frequently Asked Questions

Does this cost anything?
No. The tool is a free HTML file. ChatGPT has a free tier that covers all searches. There is no API key, no subscription, and no usage fee.

How accurate is the data?
ChatGPT searches the web in real time for each query, so results reflect publicly available information. Company names, industries, and websites are generally accurate. Phone numbers and contact names should always be verified before calling — treat them as a starting point, not a guaranteed source of truth.

Can I search the same state twice?
Yes. Each search is independent and may return different companies. ChatGPT introduces natural variety, so running the same state twice often yields a different set of prospects.

What if the Load Results button doesn't work?
The tool is looking for a block of structured data (JSON) in ChatGPT's response. If it fails: make sure you copied the entire response from top to bottom, including the code block at the end. If ChatGPT only returned text without a code block, ask it: "Please format your response as JSON using the schema I provided."

Can I customize the industries or target revenue range?
Yes — ask your manager or the person who set up the tool. The research prompt is embedded in the HTML file and can be edited in any text editor (Notepad, TextEdit) in about 5 minutes.
